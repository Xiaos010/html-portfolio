<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am studying in the Computer Programming department at Afyon Kocatepe University Sinanpa≈üa Vocational School. I completed my high school education graduating from the Database Sciences department. Currently, my goal is to successfully complete my current program and become a web developer. Throughout this process, I aim to expand my knowledge in computer programming and gain a deeper expertise in web development. </p>

<p>I spent my childhood and adolescence in Antalya. During this period, I had the opportunity to work at a technical service company. This experience not only added to my knowledge in programming but also provided me with expertise in computer repair and service. However, the technical service and repair training I received there led me a bit away from my true passion, which is programming. Therefore, in order to return to the field I am truly passionate about, I chose to enroll in the Computer Programming department at a university. Now, I am practicing the profession I love and seizing the opportunity to further develop myself in the field of programming.</p>
